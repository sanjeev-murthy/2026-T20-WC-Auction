2026 T20 WC Auction Website
Venkat, Ankit and Gentlemen we are proud to announce our in-house production - The Great Cricket Heist. 2026 comes with a breath of freshness and that freshness is now coming into our T20 Auction. Presenting to you our own website for the Auction powered by AI. We would like you to explore this website and play around with it so that we can tend to any questions and concerns before auction day Wednesday. Do check out the Live Auction website as well as the AI-generated comments on each player delivered by Akash Chopra-esque AI called Akashvaani.
Below are some pointers on the tabs to understand:
1. Live Auction
	Opens a new window with the auction website. You will need a login ID and password which will be provided to you to explore. Do not try to enter the Admin account - because you are NOT. When the bidding opens you will see a drawn player name from a certain lot. The bid amount will auto-update as the bidding goes on. You can also see bidding history going on live. If you scroll down you will see each contestant's teams with their players. You will also see your own team in the middle. When the player is to be sold you will see a Going Once..Twice..Sold! Message with a sound indicating the bid is done. One interesting feature we added is a Trading Window where once the window is opened, you can broadcast interests, give offers to other players. You will see transaction requests in a Trading inbox which you either Accept, Decline or Counter. Once trade is completed you will see the players and budget adjusted accordingly. 
2. Players DB
	This opens a list of squad players with Akashvaani comments on each player. Feel free to play with the filters.
3. Official Squads
	Data source of Players DB displayed in a better readable format
4. Contestants
	This tab links Player names to their team, price bought and points earned. This page is still under construction
5. Rules and Points System
	Basic rules and points system for this auction
6. Tournament Schedule
	Tournament Schedule - still needs updating since Bangladesh matches still show up xD
7. Standings Table
	Table will be updated once tournament begins. This will also swallow the Contestant tabs creating hyperlinks to the names in the table itself rather than have a separate tab
