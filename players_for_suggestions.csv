PLAYER	ROLE 	Country	Lot	Price Range	Rating	Price Target	Aakash's Expert Analysis																	
Suryakumar Yadav 	Batsman 	India	1	2	💰 TIJORI TOD	$22.00 	He doesn't look at fielders, he looks for empty seats in the stands! If SKY is playing, the bowler is praying.																	
Abhishek Sharma	All-rounder	India	1	2	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$4.50 	Explosive talent! He hits the ball hard, but sometimes forgets there are 20 overs, not just 2. A firecracker that can burst anywhere.																	
Tilak Varma 	Batsman 	India	1	2	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$9.00 	A touch of class in a chaotic format. He plays spin so late he can read the manufacturer's label on the ball. Perfect anchor.																	
 Sanju Samson 	Wicket Keeper	India	1	2	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$4.00 	Poetry in motion when he hits, a tragedy when he misses. He will win you one game single-handedly and break your heart in the next three.																	
Shivam Dube	All-rounder	India	1	2	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$7.00 	The "Spin Destroyer"! Footwork? Who needs footwork when you have muscle? He stands tall and deposits spinners into the parking lot.																	
Ishan Kishan	Wicket Keeper	India	1	2	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.50 	Pocket Dynamo! He loves the ball coming onto the bat, but if the pitch is slow, he gets stuck like a car in traffic.																	
Hardik Pandya 	All-rounder	India	1	2	💰 TIJORI TOD	$19.00 	Kung Fu Pandya! He walks with swagger and finishes with power. In the subcontinent, a seam-bowling all-rounder who hits spin is rarer than a unicorn.																	
Arshdeep Singh 	Bowler	India	1	2	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$11.50 	The "Paaji" of death overs! He swings the new ball like a banana and lands yorkers on a coin. Stress-free buy.																	
Jasprit Bumrah 	Bowler	India	1	2	💰 TIJORI TOD	$24.00 	The Cheat Code. Even his "bad balls" take wickets. Buying him is like buying an insurance policy for your bowling attack—guaranteed returns!																	
Harshit Rana 	Bowler	India	1	2	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.50 	Aggressive and in-your-face! He has the skills and the "flying kiss" send-off, but needs to make sure he doesn't leak runs in his anger.																	
Varun Chakravarthy	Bowler	India	1	2	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$7.50 	The Architect! His mystery is back, and on slow tracks, he is unplayable. If the pitch offers grip, he will run through the lineup like a hot knife through butter.																	
Kuldeep Yadav 	Bowler	India	1	2	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$14.50 	The Magician! When the ball turns, batters dance to his tunes. He doesn't just take wickets; he embarrasses the opposition.																	
Axar Patel 	All-rounder	India	1	2	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$13.00 	"Bapu" is the ultimate 3D player—economical bowling, clutch batting, and rocket arm. He quietly wins you matches while others make the noise.																	
Washington Sundar	All-rounder	India	1	2	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$5.50 	Tall, lanky, and stingy! He bowls in the powerplay like a miser refusing to lend money. Very high value on turning tracks.																	
Rinku Singh	Batsman 	India	1	2	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$10.50 	Lord Rinku! The man has ice water in his veins. If you need 20 runs in the last over, he is the only guy who won't even blink.																	
Gerhard Erasmus 	All-rounder	Namibia	1	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$4.00 	The Backbone! He bats, he bowls spin, he captains, and he fields with passion. If Namibia has a hope, it starts and ends with him. A must-have budget all-rounder.																	
Zane Green 	Wicket Keeper	Namibia	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A safe pair of hands behind the stumps, but with the bat, he is often stuck in first gear. In T20s, you need a Ferrari, not a tractor.																	
Bernard Scholtz 	Bowler	Namibia	1	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$2.50 	The Professor of Discipline! He bowls left-arm spin and barely gives an inch. On turning tracks, he is a nightmare for batters trying to slog.																	
Ruben Trumpelmann 	Bowler	Namibia	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.00 	The lefty who swings it! If there is moisture in the air or pitch, he becomes Mitchell Starc for the first 2 overs. A brilliant new-ball gamble.																	
JJ Smit 	All-rounder	Namibia	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	A hard-hitting finisher! Injuries have reduced his bowling, but if he connects with the bat, the ball stays hit. High impact, but fitness is a worry.																	
Jan Frylinck 	All-rounder	Namibia	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	The Fox! He doesn't have pace, but he has 50 variations of slower balls. On a slow, gripping wicket, he is very difficult to get away.																	
Louren Steenkamp 	All-rounder	Namibia	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A domestic stalwart, but the jump to international quality is too high. He might struggle against express pace.																	
Malan Kruger 	Batsman	Namibia	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Solid technique, but "solid" doesn't win fantasy leagues. He lacks the explosive power game needed for this format.																	
Nicole Loftie-Eaton	Wicket Keeper	Namibia	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	The X-Factor! He holds the record for the fastest T20I century (33 balls!). He is inconsistent, but if he clicks, you win the league.																	
Jack Brassell	Bowler	Namibia	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A young kid learning his trade. He has potential for the future, but throwing him into a mega auction now is too early.																	
Ben Shikongo 	Bowler	Namibia	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A backup seamer who runs in hard, but lacks the weapons to trouble top-tier international batters.																	
JC Balt 	All-rounder	Namibia	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Very new to the scene. We haven't seen enough "dhamaka" to justify a bid. Pass.																	
Dylan Leicher 	All-rounder	Namibia	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A developmental all-rounder. Keep an eye on him for the 2028 World Cup, but for now, save your virtual cash.																	
WP Myburgh 	Bowler	Namibia	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Likely a squad player who carries the drinks. You need points on the board, not hydration.																	
Max Heingo 	Bowler	Namibia	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Another backup option. Unless you are building a Namibia-only XI for a challenge, look elsewhere.																	
Scott Edwards 	Wicket Keeper	Netherlands	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.00 	Captain Courageous! He doesn't have a power game, but he sweeps everything—pace, spin, even the dust off the pitch. Good for stability, bad for strike rate.																	
Colin Ackermann	All-rounder	Netherlands	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	A solid county professional. He gives you stability with the bat and bowls handy off-spin, but he won't set the stadium on fire. A safe "Dal Chawal" pick.																	
Noah Croes 	Wicket Keeper	Netherlands	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A young backup keeper. Unless your main keeper is injury-prone and you have $0.5 left, look elsewhere.																	
Bas de Leede 	All-rounder	Netherlands	1	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$6.00 	The One-Man Army! He bowls heavy pace at the death and bats in the top 4. Buying him is like buying two players for the price of one. Massive value!																	
Aryan Dutt 	Bowler	Netherlands	1	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$4.00 	A tall off-spinner who dares to bowl in the powerplay. He doesn't turn it much, but his height and accuracy annoy batters into making mistakes.																	
Fred Klaassen	Bowler	Netherlands	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$1.00 	A decent left-arm pacer, but he lacks the X-factor to trouble top-tier international batters on flat tracks.																	
Kyle Klein 	Bowler	Netherlands	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Very young and raw. He is a project for the future, not a weapon for your high-stakes auction war today.																	
Michael Levitt 	All-rounder	Netherlands	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	A clean hitter of the cricket ball! He can surprise you with a quickfire 30 at the top, but he is still unproven against high-quality spin.																	
Zach Lion-Cachet 	Batsman 	Netherlands	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A developmental player. Save your virtual money for someone who is guaranteed to make the starting XI.																	
Max O'Dowd	Batsman 	Netherlands	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	The Anchor. He will stay at the crease, but sometimes he stays too long without scoring fast enough. Good for collapse prevention only.																	
Logan van Beek 	Bowler	Netherlands	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.00 	The Super Over Hero! He brings incredible energy and can hit big sixes, but his bowling can be expensive if he misses his yorker.																	
Timm van der Gugten 	All-rounder	Netherlands	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$1.00 	An experienced campaigner, but his pace has dropped significantly. On a good batting track, he might become "run-machine" for the opposition.																	
Roelof van der Merwe 	Bowler	Netherlands	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	The Bulldog! He has more passion than skill at this age, but he fights for every inch on turning tracks. A good vibe player.																	
Paul van Meekeren	Bowler	Netherlands	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$1.00 	Fast and skiddy, but can be very erratic. He bowls one unplayable delivery followed by two wide balls. Frustrating to own.																	
Saqib Zulfiqar	All-rounder	Netherlands	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A bits-and-pieces leg-spinner who doesn't offer enough impact with bat or ball to warrant a precious overseas slot.

Paul Stirling 	All-rounder	Ireland	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.50 	"Stirlo" is a legend! Hits the ball harder than anyone, but fitness and age are catching up. Still a threat in the powerplay.																	
Mark Adair 	Bowler	Ireland	1	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$4.50 	A genuine wicket-taker! He swings the new ball and whacks sixes at No. 8. A very valuable utility player.																	
Ross Adair 	Batsman 	Ireland	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	Paul's brother. Aggressive opener who goes "Bang-Bang" or back to the pavilion. A gamble for the brave.																	
Ben Calitz 	Batsman 	Ireland	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Not a known commodity in top-tier international T20s yet. Better to skip.																	
Curtis Campher 	All-rounder	Ireland	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.00 	The fighter! He took 4 wickets in 4 balls once. Scrappy with the bat and ball, always involved in the game.																	
Gareth Delany 	All-rounder	Ireland	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	Leg-spin all-rounder. Good fielder, hits long balls, but his bowling consistency is a bit of a lottery.																	
George Dockrell 	All-rounder	Ireland	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	Reinvented from spinner to finisher. Smart cricketer, but lacks the raw power of elite finishers.																	
Matthew Humphreys 	All-rounder	Ireland	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.00 	Young left-arm spinner. A project player who could be handy on turners, but inexperienced.																	
Josh Little 	Bowler	Ireland	1	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$6.00 	IPL quality! Left-arm pace, hits the deck hard. He is Ireland's only true "Premium" T20 asset.																	
Barry McCarthy 	Bowler	Ireland	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$1.00 	Famous for that boundary save, but his bowling can be fodder for big hitters on small grounds.																	
Harry Tector 	Batsman 	Ireland	1	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$4.00 	Pure Class. He plays spin beautifully and anchors the innings. A touch of elegance in a power-hitting world.																	
Tim Tector 	Batsman 	Ireland	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Harry's younger brother. Still developing and not ready for the big stage yet.																	
Lorcan Tucker 	Wicket Keeper	Ireland	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.50 	Very busy player! Loves the scoop and reverse sweep. Keeps the scoreboard moving and annoys the bowlers.																	
Ben White 	Bowler	Ireland	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	A leg-spinner useful in Asia, but often bowls too short. If he finds his length, he takes wickets.																	
Craig Young 	Bowler	Ireland	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$1.00 	A hit-the-deck bowler who gets bounce, but lacks variations. Good depth player, but not a starter.

Shai Hope	Wicket Keeper	West Indies 	1	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$1.50 	Classy as a Rolls Royce, but sometimes you need a Ferrari in T20s. He plays beautiful drives, but "beauty" doesn't always equal "strike rate". Good anchor, but might slow you down.																	
 Shimron Hetmyer	Batsman	West Indies 	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$5.00 	Hetty is pure dynamite! He hits spin into the orbit and celebrates with swag. But his fitness and form can fluctuate like the Sensex. High risk, massive reward.																	
 Johnson Charles	Wicket Keeper	West Indies 	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$4.00 	Stand and Deliver! He doesn't move his feet, he just uses brute force. If it's in his arc, it's out of the park. If it swings, he’s in trouble.																	
 Roston Chase	All-rounder	West Indies 	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$4.50 	The "Fevicol" of the team. When the top order collapses (which happens often!), he sticks around. Plus, his off-spin is gold on turning tracks. Very smart utility pick.																	
 Matthew Forde	Bowler	West Indies 	1	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.50 	A young gun with serious talent! He swings the new ball and can whack long sixes down the order. An underrated all-round package who flies under the radar.																	
 Jason Holder	All-rounder	West Indies 	1	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$9.00 	The Gentle Giant! Experienced, gets extra bounce because he's 9 feet tall, and hits long balls. A safe, reliable buy who gives you balance.																	
 Akeal Hosein	Bowler	West Indies 	1	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$8.50 	The Sniper! He attacks the stumps in the powerplay with his arm-ball. Very disciplined, very economical. In subcontinent conditions, he is a must-have.																	
 Shamar Joseph	Bowler	West Indies 	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.00 	The Hero of Gabba! He has pace, passion, and a broken toe story. Raw energy is high, but T20 experience is low. A wildcard entry!																	
 Brandon King	Batsman	West Indies 	1	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$7.50 	Elegance personified. He sets the platform nicely. On a flat deck, he looks like a million dollars. Solid, reliable opener who doesn't throw his wicket away easily.																	
 Gudakesh Motie	All-rounder	West Indies 	1	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$6.00 	Chhupa Rustam Alert! This guy is a wicket-taking machine in the middle overs. Left-arm spin that turns and grips. Batters often underestimate him and pay the price!																	
 Rovman Powell	Batsman	West Indies 	1	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$8.00 	Captain Power! He hits sixes that threaten the satellites. Spin or pace, it doesn't matter. A genuine match-winner who leads from the front.																	
 Sherfane Rutherford	All-rounder	West Indies 	1	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$5.50 	The Finisher! He has been in lethal form in leagues around the world. He waits for the death overs and then unleashes chaos. Great value buy.																	
 Quentin Sampson	All-rounder	West Indies 	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	A mystery card! A hard-hitting all-rounder from Guyana who can surprise everyone. If you want a cheap "punt" that might turn into a jackpot, he's your man.																	
 Jayden Seales	Bowler	West Indies 	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.00 	Young, fast, and skiddy. He is a serious talent in Test cricket, but still learning the dark arts of T20 death bowling. Buy for potential!																	
 Romario Shepherd	All-rounder	West Indies 	1	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$5.00 	The "Shepherd" who guides the ball to the boundary! Massive hitter at No. 7 or 8. His bowling can be expensive, but he picks up wickets with his variations.

 David Miller	Batsman	South Africa	1	2	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$8.00 	"Killer Miller"! If it's in the arc, it's out of the park. Experienced finisher who knows how to win tight games.																	
 Lungi Ngidi	Bowler	South Africa	1	2	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.50 	He has good slower ones, but on a bad day, he leaks runs like a broken tap. Middle-overs gamble.																	
 Anrich Nortje	Bowler	South Africa	1	2	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$5.00 	Raw Speed! He bowls rockets, but sometimes rockets travel to the boundary very fast. Coming back from injuries, so handle with care.

 Lockie Ferguson	Bowler	New Zealand	1	2	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$5.50 	Express pace! He is a Ferrari engine in a fragile body. If he plays, he takes wickets; if he doesn't, he takes up a slot.

 Daryl Mitchell	All-rounder	New Zealand	1	2	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$9.50 	The Crisis Man. When the team is in trouble, he stands tall. Hits spin down the ground with immense power.																	
 James Neesham	All-rounder	New Zealand	1	2	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.00 	The freelancer! He can win you a match with a 15-ball cameo, but consistency is his biggest enemy.

 Sediqullah Atal	Batsman	Afghanistan	1	1	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Young talent, but too raw for this level of competition. Let him cook in domestic cricket first.

 Rahmanullah Gurbaz	Wicket Keeper	Afghanistan	1	1	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$9.00 	Fire and Ice (mostly fire). He attacks from ball one. A dangerous opener who can take the game away in minutes.																	
 Naveen Ul Haq	Bowler	Afghanistan	1	1	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$5.50 	The Master of Slower Balls. He has so many variations that even the batter gets confused. Clutch death bowler.																	
 Mohammad Ishaq	Wicket Keeper	Afghanistan	1	1	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A backup keeper without the batting credentials to demand a spot. Pass.																	
 Shahidullah Kamal	All-rounder	Afghanistan	1	1	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A squad player. Doesn't have the impact to be in your fantasy XI.																	
 Mohammad Nabi	All-rounder	Afghanistan	1	1	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.00 	The President! Vast experience, safe hands, and cool head. But age is catching up, and the strike rate is dipping.																	
 Gulbadin Naib	All-rounder	Afghanistan	1	1	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.50 	The Muscle Man! He flexes his biceps and hits big shots. A "vibes" based player who can be a match-winner on his day.																	
 Azmatullah Omarzai	All-rounder	Afghanistan	1	1	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$6.50 	A Gem! He swings the new ball and hits it miles with the bat. A proper, high-quality all-rounder who balances the side.																	
 Mujeeb Ur Rahman	Bowler	Afghanistan	1	1	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$4.00 	The Mystery is there, but so are the fitness issues. If he plays, he is dangerous. If he is injured, he is expensive bench strength.																	
 Darwish Rasooli	Batsman	Afghanistan	1	1	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Hasn't shown enough impact at the international level yet. Skip.																	
 Ibrahim Zadran	Batsman	Afghanistan	1	1	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$6.50 	The Anchor. Technically solid as a rock. He holds one end up while the others go "Bang Bang."
