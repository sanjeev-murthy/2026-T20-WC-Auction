Jatinder Singh 	Batsman 	Oman 	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	The "Muscle Man" of Oman! He celebrates wickets by flexing his biceps, and sometimes he flexes his bat too. A solid opener who can anchor, but don't expect a strike rate of 200.
Vinayak Shukla 	Wicket Keeper	Oman 	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	A busy player behind the stumps and in front of them. He is decent against spin, but in a pool full of Klaasens and Poorans, he is strictly a "break glass in case of emergency" option.
Mohammad Nadeem 	All-rounder	Oman 	2	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$2.50 	The veteran workhorse! He bowls medium pace that grips the surface and can hit a long ball. On a slow pitch in Dhaka or Chennai, he is worth his weight in gold.
Shakeel Ahmad 	Bowler	Oman 	2	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$2.00 	Left-arm orthodox magic! He doesn't spin it a mile, but he bowls so accurately you could balance a coin on his length. A budget Keshav Maharaj.
Hammad Mirza 	Wicket Keeper	Oman 	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A young keeper who is still finding his feet. He has potential, but in a high-stakes auction, you need points today, not promises for tomorrow.
Wasim Ali 	All-rounder	Oman 	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	A lefty who bowls spin—always a good combo! He can float up the order and hit a few, but consistency is a bit like the weather—unpredictable.
Karan Sonavale 	All-rounder	Oman 	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A batting all-rounder who rolls his arm over. He is a "bits and pieces" player, but the pieces are a bit too small for this level.
Shah Faisal 	Bowler	Oman 	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	Left-arm angle! That alone gets him a look. He swings the new ball back into the right-hander. If the pitch helps, he is dangerous; if not, he is expensive.
Nadeem Khan 	Bowler	Oman 	2	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$2.00 	Alert! Left-arm wrist spin! This is a rare commodity. Batters struggle to pick him, and in T20s, mystery is money. A very smart budget pick.
Sufyan Mehmood 	Bowler	Oman 	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A medium pacer who relies on swing. If the sun is out and the pitch is flat, he becomes a bowling machine for the opposition batters.
Jay Odedra 	All-rounder	Oman 	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	An off-spinning all-rounder, but his stats suggest he is more of a "container" than a "wicket-taker". You need wickets to win.
Shafiq Jan 	All-rounder	Oman 	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Listed as an all-rounder, but hasn't set the stage on fire with either skill. Save your budget for impact players.
Ashish Odedara 	Batsman 	Oman 	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A technically correct batter, but T20 is about chaos, not correctness. He might eat up too many deliveries in the powerplay.
Jiten Ramanandi 	All-rounder	Oman 	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	Left-arm seamer and lefty batter. He brings the "lefty" advantage to the table. A decent utility player if you need to balance your combinations.
Hasnain Ali Shah 	All-rounder	Oman 	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A medium-fast bowler who can bat a bit. Good for domestic circuits, but international power-hitters might find him too easy to line up.

Wayne Madsen	Batsman	Italy	2	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$3.50 	The "Godfather" of the team! A County legend with Derbyshire. He sweeps, reverse sweeps, and brings decades of experience. Like a fine Italian wine, he gets better with age.
 Marcus Campopiano	Wicket Keeper	Italy	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	A solid keeper-batter with a decent average of 31. He can anchor the innings, but in T20s, we need "allegro" (fast), not "andante" (slow). Good backup.
 Gian Piero Meade	Wicket Keeper	Italy	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A bits-and-pieces player. His stats (Avg 17, SR 102) suggest he struggles to change gears. In a high-scoring auction, he is a passenger.
 Zain Ali	All-rounder	Italy	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Very new to the international circuit with only a handful of games. He is still learning his trade; let him develop in the domestic leagues first.
 Ali Hasan	Bowler	Italy	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	Left-arm angle! That alone makes him interesting. He has decent numbers (8 wickets in 6 games), but hasn't been tested against big power-hitters yet.
 Crishan Jorge	Bowler	Italy	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	A leg-spinner who can take wickets in clumps (best of 4/17). On a turning track, he could be a surprise weapon, but consistency is a question mark.
 Harry Manenti	All-rounder	Italy	2	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.00 	The Australian-Italian connection! A proper all-rounder who hits the ball hard and bowls medium pace. He brings that "Aussie grit" to the Italian flair.
 Anthony Mosca	Batsman	Italy	2	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$2.50 	A run-machine for Italy! He averages nearly 40 which is gold in Associate cricket. He holds the innings together while others play shots.
 Justin Mosca	Batsman	Italy	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	The other Mosca brother. He hits more boundaries (SR ~148) but gets out faster. High impact, but short duration at the crease.
 Syed Naqvi	All-rounder	Italy	2	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A fringe player with very little data to back up a bid. In an auction of 300 players, he is likely to go unsold.
 Benjamin Manenti	Bowler	Italy	2	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	Harry's brother. He bowls off-spin and has played high-level cricket in Australia. A smart operator who knows how to bowl on flat decks.
 Jaspreet Singh	All-rounder	Italy	2	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$2.50 	A wicket-taker! He has taken 21 wickets for Italy and is a strike bowler. He attacks the stumps and is always in the game.
 JJ Smuts	All-rounder	Italy	2	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$4.00 	The biggest name here! Ex-South African international. He bats top order, bowls left-arm spin, and has tons of experience. A verified match-winner.
 Grant Stewart	Bowler	Italy	2	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.50 	Another County Pro (Kent)! A seam-bowling all-rounder who strikes at 159. He hits long balls down the order and bowls heavy balls. High value.
 Thomas Draca	Bowler	Italy	2	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.00 	"The Australian". He played Global T20 Canada and was a top wicket-taker. A serious bowler who hits the deck hard. Watch out for him!
Rohit Paudel	All-rounder	Nepal	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$4.50 	Captain Marvel! He is young but plays with an old head (Avg 27). He anchors the chase and can roll his arm over. The glue of the team.
 Dipendra Singh Airee	All-rounder	Nepal	3	0.5	💰 TIJORI TOD	$7.00 	The "Tiger" of Nepal! Gun fielder, bowls spin, and hit 6 sixes in an over!. He is a complete T20 package who wins matches single-handedly.
 Sandeep Lamichhane	Bowler	Nepal	3	0.5	💰 TIJORI TOD	$8.00 	The Global Superstar. He has 129 wickets in just 68 matches!. On a turning track, he is a cheat code. If he is available, you buy him blindly.
 Kushal Bhurtel	Batsman	Nepal	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.50 	He lives by the sword and dies by the sword. An aggressive opener (SR 127) who attacks from ball one. If he connects, it's fireworks!
 Aasif Sheikh	Wicket Keeper	Nepal	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$3.50 	The steady hand. He complements Bhurtel perfectly. A reliable keeper-batter who builds partnerships. Solid, safe investment.
 Sundeep Jora	Batsman	Nepal	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.50 	The young gun! He holds the record for being the youngest to score a T20I fifty. Explosive talent, but still finding consistency.
 Aarif Sheikh	All-rounder	Nepal	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	The stabilizer. He averages 19 and bowls medium pace. A useful utility player for the middle overs, but won't win you games alone.
 Basir Ahamad	Bowler	Nepal	3	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.00 	Left-arm orthodox spinner who can bat! He averages 61 with the bat (small sample). A very handy lower-order package.
 Sompal Kami	All-rounder	Nepal	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$4.00 	The veteran warhorse. He bowls brisk pace upfront and can hit lusty blows at the end. Experience counts for a lot in pressure situations.
 Karan KC	All-rounder	Nepal	3	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$4.50 	The finisher! He has taken 106 wickets and hits huge sixes to win thrillers. A high-impact player who is involved in every moment.
 Nandan Yadav	All-rounder	Nepal	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A medium pacer with decent stats (15 wickets), but in a team full of stars like Kami and Karan, he is a backup option.
 Gulshan Jha	Bowler	Nepal	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.50 	A young fast bowler who can bat! He strikes at 144. Very raw, very exciting, but can leak runs like a broken dam.
 Lalit Rajbanshi	Bowler	Nepal	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$3.00 	The Accountant. He bowls left-arm spin with an economy of 6.38. He won't give you anything for free. Perfect for defending totals.
 Sher Malla	Bowler	Nepal	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	An off-spinner who is still breaking into the main side. Needs more international exposure before you bid for him.
 Lokesh Bam	Wicket Keeper	Nepal	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	A power hitter (SR 145!) but averages only 13. He is a "hit or miss" player. If he stays for 2 overs, he changes the momentum.
Richie Berrington 	All-rounder	Scotland	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$6.50 	The Captain! He hits the ball as hard as anyone in world cricket. He anchors the innings and bowls heavy medium pace. A solid, reliable pick who leads from the front.
 Tom Bruce	All-rounder	Scotland	3	0.5	💰 TIJORI TOD	$8.50 	Big Signing Alert! The former New Zealand Kiwi is now a Highlander!. He brings T20I experience against top teams. Buying him is like buying a premium brand at a discount price.
 Matthew Cross	Wicket Keeper	Scotland	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$4.50 	"Crossy" is technically superb. He pulls the ball brilliantly and is a very vocal keeper. He won't give you a strike rate of 200, but he won't give his wicket away for free either.
 Bradley Currie	Bowler	Scotland	3	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$5.00 	A genuine swing bowler! He has taken wickets for Sussex in county cricket. If the conditions are cloudy, he becomes unplayable. A very smart budget buy for the new ball.
 Oliver Davidson	Bowler	Scotland	3	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.50 	Young left-arm spinner! He is tall and gets bounce. He impressed in the U19 World Cup. In Asian conditions, a tall left-arm spinner is a weapon you want in your arsenal.
 Chris Greaves	Bowler	Scotland	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$3.00 	The man who stunned Bangladesh! He bowls leg-spin and plays incredible scoops. He is a pure "Impact Player"—can win you the game or cost you the game in one over.
 Zainullah Ihsan	Bowler	Scotland	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.50 	Mystery Pick! An Afghan-born pacer who now plays for Scotland. He has raw pace and that "Afghan aggression." A high-risk, high-reward gamble if you need speed.
 Michael Jones	Batsman	Scotland	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$5.50 	Classy opener. He scores big hundreds (like against England in the World Cup). He plays proper cricketing shots. If you want stability at the top, he is your man.
 Michael Leask	All-rounder	Scotland	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$4.00 	The "Beast" of Scotland! He hits the ball harder than anyone in the Associate world. He can turn a match in 10 balls, but his off-spin is sometimes a bit expensive.
 Finlay McCreath	All-rounder	Scotland	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A young batter still finding his feet at this level. In a team full of seasoned pros like Berrington and Munsey, he is likely a bench warmer.
 Brandon McMullen	All-rounder	Scotland	3	0.5	💰 TIJORI TOD	$9.00 	The MVP! He bats at No. 3 like Kallis and bowls swing like Anderson (okay, maybe not that good, but you get the point!). He is Scotland's most valuable asset right now.
 George Munsey	Batsman	Scotland	3	0.5	💰 TIJORI TOD	$8.00 	The Reverse-Sweep King! He plays the reverse sweep better than the forward defense. He destroys spinners. On a turning track, he is actually safer than a straight-bat player!
 Safyaan Sharif	Bowler	Scotland	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$4.50 	The Yorker Specialist. He has been doing it for a decade. He nails the yorkers at the death. Not the fastest, but very clever. A safe pair of hands.
 Mark Watt	Bowler	Scotland	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$7.00 	"Watt a Player!" He bowls from 24 yards (behind the crease) to mess with the batter's timing. Economical, takes wickets, and has a great attitude. A must-buy spinner.
 Bradley Wheal	Bowler	Scotland	3	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$5.50 	He plays for Hampshire and bowls heat! He hits the deck hard and gets bounce. A proper fast bowler who can trouble even the best batters on his day.

Dilpreet Bajwa (c)	All-rounder	Canada	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	The Captain! Hits the ball hard and bowls useful overs. A good utility player, but can he handle the pressure of a big price tag?
 Ajayveer Hundal	All-rounder	Canada	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Young talent, but not auction-ready yet. Needs more seasoning in domestic cricket before facing the big boys.
 Ansh Patel	All-rounder	Canada	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A spin-bowling all-rounder still developing his craft. Pass for now.
 Dilon Heyliger	Bowler	Canada	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	West Indian flair! Hits long balls down the order and bowls heavy medium pace. A bit expensive with the ball, but entertaining.
 Harsh Thaker	All-rounder	Canada	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$2.00 	Steady as a rock. He doesn't do anything flashy, but he builds partnerships and bowls tight overs. A good "glue" player.
 Jaskarandeep Buttar	Bowler	Canada	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Backup pacer. Unless you need to fill a quota, look for someone with more international wickets.
 Kaleem Sana	Bowler	Canada	3	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.00 	Left-arm pace is gold! He swings the new ball and has decent pace. A very good budget option for the powerplay.
 Kanwarpal Tathgur	Batsman	Canada	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Not enough data to justify a bid. High risk, low reward.
 Navneet Dhaliwal	All-rounder	Canada	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$1.50 	Experienced opener who scored big in the World Cup. He anchors well, but his strike rate is a bit slow for modern T20s.
 Nicholas Kirton	All-rounder	Canada	3	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.50 	Lefty Elegance! Looked like Brian Lara’s cousin against USA. Plays spin beautifully; a smart middle-order pick.
 Ravinderpal Singh	Batsman	Canada	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A power hitter who swings for the fences. If he connects, it's six; if not, he's out. Too inconsistent.
 Saad Bin Zafar	All-rounder	Canada	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$2.50 	The Professor. Bowled a maiden in a Super Over! He never gives runs. If you want economy, he is your man.
 Shivam Sharma	Bowler	Canada	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	A spinner without much mystery. Batters line him up easily.
 Shreyas Movva	Wicket Keeper	Canada	3	0.5	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$2.00 	A tidy keeper and smart batter. Saved Canada from collapses multiple times. Reliable backup option.
 Yuvraj Samra	Batsman	Canada	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Domestic player. Unlikely to feature in a playing XI.
Muhammad Waseem (c)	Batsman	UAE	3	0.5	💰 TIJORI TOD	$5.50 	The "Sultan of Sixes!" Hits sixes for fun. Arguably the best Associate batter. Buy him, open with him, watch the fireworks!
 Alishan Sharafu	All-rounder	UAE	3	0.5	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	Young talent who looks a million dollars driving. Needs to convert stylish 20s into match-winning 50s.

 Junaid Siddique	Bowler	UAE	3	0.5	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.50 	Aggression personified! Stares down batters, bowls fast yorkers. Brings "fast bowler energy" to the team.

 Rohid Khan	Bowler	UAE	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Young pacer, raw. Needs refinement.
 Sohaib Khan	Batsman	UAE	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Squad filler. Unlikely to play.
 Simranjeet Singh	Bowler	UAE	3	0.5	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Another medium pacer in a sea of medium pacers. Avoid.
Monank Patel (c)	Wicket Keeper	USA	2	1	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$3.50 	Captain America! Anchored the chase against Pakistan. Solid technique, plays spin well. Safe pick.
 Jessy Singh	Bowler	USA	2	1	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	An honest trier, but lacks the pace or mystery to trouble top batters.
 Andries Gous	Wicket Keeper	USA	2	1	💰 TIJORI TOD	$6.50 	Class. Pure Class. Batted like a dream in the World Cup. Plays pace and spin equally well. Must-have top-order bat.
 Shehan Jayasuriya	All-rounder	USA	2	1	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$4.00 	Ex-Sri Lankan international with vast experience. Top order bat, off-spin bowl. A luxury for an Associate team.
 Milind Kumar	All-rounder	USA	2	1	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	Ranji Trophy veteran. Brings stability, won't collapse under pressure, but won't hit 6 sixes in an over either.
 Shayan Jahangir	Wicket Keeper	USA	2	1	⛔ REHNE DO	$1.00 	Talented batter, but gets stuck at the crease. Strike rate is a major concern.
 Saiteja Mukkamala	Batsman	USA	2	1	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Solid technique, but T20 demands more power. Maybe in a few years.
 Sanjay Krishnamurthi	All-rounder	USA	2	1	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Young talent, looked good in MLC, but still very raw for international pressure.
 Harmeet Singh	All-rounder	USA	2	1	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.00 	"Left-arm Spin + Slogging." Knows Indian pitches perfectly. Can win you a game with a cameo or tight spell.
 Nosthush Kenjige	Bowler	USA	2	1	🦊 CHHUPA RUSTAM	$3.00 	The Professor of Spin. Took 3 wickets vs Pakistan! Deadly accurate on turning tracks. Undervalued.
 Shadley Van Schalkwyk	All-rounder	USA	2	1	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.50 	Utility player. Bowls medium pace, hits a long ball. Good depth player, not a headline act.
 Saurabh Netravalkar	Bowler	USA	2	1	💰 TIJORI TOD	$7.50 	The Oracle! The Engineer! The Hero! Swings it in powerplay, nails yorkers in Super Overs. More valuable than some full-member bowlers!
 Ali Khan	Bowler	USA	2	1	🛡️ BHAROSEMAND	$4.50 	The Yorker Machine. Played in IPL, CPL, PSL. He knows T20 inside out. Your go-to death bowler.
 Mohammad Mohsin	All-rounder	USA	2	1	🎲 RISK HAI TOH ISHQ HAI	$2.00 	Leg-spinner! Can turn the ball. If conditions suit him, he's a wicket-taker; if not, he can be expensive.
 Shubham Ranjane	All-rounder	USA	2	1	⛔ REHNE DO	$0.50 	Solid domestic player who hasn't quite cracked the international code yet.
